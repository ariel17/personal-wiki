## Trading strategies

Strategies can be used simultaneously:

* Swing: Popular. Short/medium term. Capture a % of a price move. Less time,
  potential short-term profits. Require technical and fundamental analysis. Use
  1 day chart. Could miss longer term profits.
* Breakout: Short term trades (hours/days). Potential short term profits.
  Capture breakout in price. Use 1 day or hours chart. Could miss longer term
  profits. Needs specific chart setups.
* Scalping: Intra-day trades (minutes/hours), tiny movements. Requiere lots of
  time. Uses 5-10 minute charts. Requires more funds. Difficult to implement.
  Potential short-term profits. Extra opportunities on top of long-term trades.
* Dollar cost averaging: Investment, NOT trading. NO FOMO. Long-term strategy.
  Fundamental analysis. No interested in short-term: based on "markets always go
  up". Low cost. Uses 1 day charts. Can face significant losses over time.

## Order types

* Order book: red -> sellers, green -> buyers. Buyers: best bid -> higest price;
  sellers -> best offer (ask) -> lowest price. `Spread = higest bid - lowest
  offer`.

Where to buy 1 BTC? BTC/USDT

* Market order: Choose the amount you trade, but you don't choose the price.
  Only those offering the amount of BTC you are willing to buy are the ones
  that set the price. It is very easy to use, but since the market change like
  crazy, there is the possibility that when you push the "buy" button you get a
  bad trade.
* Limit order: I set the buying price and will wait for those that _eventually_
  will come and sell at that price. We cannot guarantee we will trade the whole
  order.
* Stop market order:
