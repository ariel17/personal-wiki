## Trading strategies

Strategies can be used simultaneously:

* Swing: Popular. Short/medium term. Capture a % of a price move. Less time,
  potential short-term profits. Require technical and fundamental analysis. Use
  1 day chart. Could miss longer term profits.
* Breakout: Short term trades (hours/days). Potential short term profits.
  Capture breakout in price. Use 1 day or hours chart. Could miss longer term
  profits. Needs specific chart setups.
* Scalping: Intra-day trades (minutes/hours), tiny movements. Requiere lots of
  time. Uses 5-10 minute charts. Requires more funds. Difficult to implement.
  Potential short-term profits. Extra opportunities on top of long-term trades.
* Dollar cost averaging: Investment, NOT trading. NO FOMO. Long-term strategy.
  Fundamental analysis. No interested in short-term: based on "markets always go
  up". Low cost. Uses 1 day charts. Can face significant losses over time.

## Order types

* Order book: red -> sellers, green -> buyers. Buyers: best bid -> higest price;
  sellers -> best offer (ask) -> lowest price. `Spread = higest bid - lowest
  offer`.

Where to buy 1 BTC? BTC/USDT

* Market order: Choose the amount you trade, but you don't choose the price.
  Only those offering the amount of BTC you are willing to buy are the ones
  that set the price. It is very easy to use, but since the market change like
  crazy, there is the possibility that when you push the "buy" button you get a
  bad trade.
* Limit order: I set the buying price and will wait for those that _eventually_
  will come and sell at that price. We cannot guarantee we will trade the whole
  order.
* Stop market order: Choose the amount you trade but don't choose price (not
  guaranteed). i.e. `If price gets $57,500 sell my BTC with a market order` ->
  "stop losing my money". Will bet the best price in the market.
* Stop limit order: Choose the amount you trade, choose the price you trade.
  Will sell the specific amount with specific price.
* Stop loss order: like stop limit order. "If the price drops to this level
  then sell my BTC with a limit or market order". Important for day trading, to
  mitigate risks. The limit must be below the current trading price.
* Take profit order: like stop limit order. Important to automate trading in
  day trading. Must be above the current price. 

## Technical analysis

### Candle charts

* Each candle is a time period.
* Open, close (final prices), high and low (prices reached in offer) for time
  period is shown.

* Bullish pattern: sellers drove price lower during the day. Buyers came in and
  the price finished higher.

### Chart patterns

* Double top: buyers tried twice to push the price higher, but unable. Buyers
  run out of steam; sellers are in the market. The price would fall off.

* Double bottom: Sellers came in twice, but found the support of buyers and
  happy to pay up. Sellers ran out and buyers need to pay more; buyers in the
  market.

### Trends

* Higher highs: high prices even higher in each peak.
* Lower lows: same but in reversal.
* Consolidation: steady. This can't last forever. Use this values for stop loss
  level.

Don't go against the trend since you're going against the market.

### Indicators

Mathematical models that attempt to give context to price action. Can't predict
the future.

* Moving averages: smooth out price data.
  * SMA: Arithmetic mean of prices over a given time period.
  * EMA: weighted and give more importance to recent prices.

![SMA and EMA](https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/600_Fidelity_Com_English/images/migration/article/content_15-lc/EMA_602x345.png)

[Exponential Moving Average (EMA) explanation](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/technical-analysis/technical-indicator-guide/ema)

* Relative Strength Index (RSI): plots the relative strength of the price
  compared to previous prices. Momentum indicator. Can't predict how the price
  will change in the future.
  * Above 70: price is relatively expensive (overbought)
  * Below 30: price is relatively cheap (oversold)

* Average true range: Measure of daily price volatility. The true amount the
  price could move in a given day; largest probable move in a day based on
  previous data. Can be used to set our stop-loss.
